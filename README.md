# hamburger engine - Formally known as Phlox Engine

hamburger engine is a C++ game engine built with SDL2. Attempting to keep it as similar to HaxeFlixel as possible.

This is all being done by one person so development may be slow.

The required libraries are already included because I don't wanna keep redownloading them whenever I decide to reinstall Windows.

The .nsp file in the docs folder is a forwarder for the switch version by the way, make sure hamburger-engine.nro is in:

```
/switch/hamburgerEngine/hamburger-engine.nro
```
