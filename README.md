# Phlox Engine

A C++ game engine built with OpenGL and GLFW. Attempting to keep it as similar to HaxeFlixel as possible.

This is all being done by one person so development may be slow.

The required libraries are already included because I don't wanna keep redownloading them whenever I decide to reinstall Windows.
